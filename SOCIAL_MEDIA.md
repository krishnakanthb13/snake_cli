**Subject: Promoting the Launch of Snake CLI**

🚀 Exciting News! I've just released **Snake CLI v0.0.4**! 🐍

Snake CLI is a modern, terminal-based reimagining of the classic Snake game, built entirely in Python. It's designed to bring a premium, highly customizable gaming experience directly to your command prompt.

**Why Snake CLI?**
While many terminal games are simple experiments, Snake CLI focuses on polish and persistence.
- 🎨 **Deep Customization**: Mix and match shapes, colors, and rendering modes.
- 📊 **Data-Driven**: Tracks every session with a local JSON backend, complete with leaderboards and history browsing.
- ⚙️ **Strategic Depth**: Configurable food rarity, wall modes, and speed settings.

It also solves common terminal game issues, like the "vertical speed" problem, by implementing smart horizontal scaling for a balanced experience.

It's open-source and cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS). Check it out and let me know your high score!

Hey everyone! 👋

I've just released **Snake CLI**, a project I've been working on to push the limits of what a "simple" terminal game can feel like.

**The Problem**: Most CLI Snake games are either too basic (static visuals) or require complex setups.
**The Solution**: A zero-config, highly polished game that balances retro vibes with modern features.

**Key Features:**
*   **Visuals**: Choose your pixel style (`█`, `●`, `@`, etc.) and colors. Try the "Mixed" mode for dynamic rendering!
*   **Stats**: It logs every game you play. There's a persistent leaderboard (sortable by Score or Time) and a full history browser.
*   **Gameplay**: Configurable "Big Food" chance, wall wrapping, obstacles, and adjustable speeds.
*   **Polish**: Solved the aspect ratio issue (where vertical movement feels faster) using 2x horizontal scaling.

**Tech Stack:**
*   Python 3.10+
*   `curses` (standard library + `windows-curses`)
*   JSON for data persistence
*   MVC Architecture

I'd love for you to try it out and give feedback! It includes `.bat` and `.sh` launchers so it should just work out of the box.
